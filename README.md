# FUN-ction party!

this is a webapp that will (eventually) be used as a place for users to practice
working with higher order functions.

- the app presents an incomplete implementation of a higher order function
- the user completes it and runs it
- the app tells them whether they got it right

## local dev

```
$ npm i && npm start
```
